	/// <summary>
    /// Q: Implement a method that allows you to get all the users over a certain age
    //  Q: Implement a method that removes a User from the repository - based on name.
    //  why did I use List - as the type of the list of users, and not an implementation of List?
    /// </summary>
    public interface IUserRepository
	
	//Q: add a test that will check if you add a user with the individual fields that it adds it to the repository.
    //repository.AddNewUserWith(name, age);
	
	 
	//Q: what other data structure you would use, in the UserRepository, in order to avoid having to work hard for deduplicating
	//Q: is it a good idea or not to through an exception for a duplicate?
	
	
	//Q: what is the difference between the DuplicateUserException and IllegalArgumentException?
	
	//Q: where is a better place to have this validation??
	
	//Q: what is the difference between the DuplicateUserException and IllegalArgumentException?
